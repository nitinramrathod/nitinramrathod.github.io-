          <h2>About Web-Developing Languages</h2>
          <h3>1) <i class="fab fa-html5"></i> About HTML Language</h3>
          <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>
            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
            embedded into the rendered page. <br> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,<br>
            paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <br>
            </b> <img /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about <br>
            document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. <br>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. <br>
            Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current <br>
            maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]
            </p>
          <h3>2) <i class="fab fa-css3"></i> About CSS Language</h3>
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. <br>
            [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content <br>
            accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting <br>
            by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.<br>
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as <br>
            on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate <br>
            formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]<br>
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.<br>
             This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br>
            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with<br>
             CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]<br>
            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
          </p>
          <h3>3) <i class="fab fa-php"></i> About PHP Language</h3>
          <p>PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.[5] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian <br>
             programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994;[6] the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[7] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,<br>
             [6] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[8]
            PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web<br>
            <br> server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole<br>
             or part of a HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate<br>
              the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[9]<br>
               and robotic drone control.[10] Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via command-line interface (CLI).
            The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web<br>
             servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.[11]
            The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other <br>
            implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.[12]
            As of April 2020, over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/"EOLed"[13] version 5.6 or older;[14] and with version 7.0 and 7.1 over 68%, that <br>
            are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team,[15] while security support is provided by third parties, such as Debian (up to June 2020 for PHP 5).[16] <br>
            Because of the popularity of PHP that means at least 53% of the websites in the world run on implementations of languages no longer supported by their designers.<br>
             In addition, PHP version 7.2, the most popular supported PHP version, will stop getting security updates on November 30, 2020
