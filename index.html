      <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create document
on the World Wide Web. It is simply a collection of certain key
words called ‘Tags’ that are helpful in writing the document to be
displayed using a browser on Internet.
It is a platform independent language that can be used on any
platform such as Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and so on. To
display a document in web it is essential to mark-up the different
elements (headings, paragraphs, tables, and so on) of the
document with the HTML tags. To view a mark-up document,
user has to open the document in a browser. A browser
understands and interpret the HTML tags, identifies the structure
of the document (which part are which) and makes decision about
presentation (how the parts look) of the document.
HTML also provides tags to make the document look attractive
using graphics, font size and colors. User can make a link to the
other document or the different section of the same document
by creating Hypertext Links also known as Hyperlinks
